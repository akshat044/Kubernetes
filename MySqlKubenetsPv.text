Qus - explain me one things let's say we have pod which stores data in the pv, and we have connected this pv through pvc , if let's say our pod got crashes then ?

Excellent question 👍
This is exactly the right way to think about Pods + PVC + PV.
Let’s walk through it step by step, very calmly.

Short answer first

If a Pod crashes or is deleted, the data stored in the Persistent Volume (PV) is NOT lost, as long as:

The PV is not deleted

The reclaim policy is not Delete

Now let’s explain it properly
1️⃣ What happens when a Pod crashes?
Important Kubernetes rule

Pods are ephemeral (temporary)

So if a Pod:

Crashes

Is killed

Is recreated by a Deployment

👉 The Pod object is destroyed
👉 A new Pod is created with a new name

2️⃣ What happens to the PVC?

👉 Nothing happens

PVC is a separate Kubernetes object

PVC is NOT tied to Pod lifecycle

PVC stays in Bound state

kubectl get pvc


PVC is still there.

3️⃣ What happens to the PV?

👉 Nothing happens

PV is also independent

Data is stored on:

Disk

NFS

Cloud storage (EBS, PD, etc.)

Data remains intact.

4️⃣ What happens when new Pod is created?

When Kubernetes recreates the Pod:

The Pod spec still has:

volumes:
  - name: data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: my-pvc


Kubernetes:

Attaches the same PV

Mounts it to the container path

👉 New Pod sees old data

5️⃣ Simple lifecycle flow (remember this)
Pod crashes
   ↓
Pod deleted
   ↓
PVC still bound
   ↓
PV still exists
   ↓
New Pod created
   ↓
Same PV mounted
   ↓
Data is safe
